`PermGuard` currently fully supports YAML as the primary configuration language for defining policies and permissions.
It is important to note that the definition of schemas is exclusively supported in YAML format.

Additionally, while support for PermScript is planned, it is currently under development and not yet available for use.
This ensures that users can rely on a stable and standardized approach for configuration while anticipating future enhancements.
