`PermGuard` offers a robust Command-line Interface (CLI) designed for the administration.
The CLI allows to manage accounts, identities, tenants, repositories, schemas, domains, resources, and policies.

To view a list of commands available in the current PermGuard version, users can run the `permguard` command without any additional arguments.
