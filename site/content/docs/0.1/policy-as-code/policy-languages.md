**PermGuard** fully supports `Cedar` as the primary policy language.

`PermGuard` enforces a **mandatory single schema** for each `ledger`.

## Schema Management in Policy Languages

To improve the developer experience, each policy language can define its own **schema grammar**.

- When using `Cedar`, **PermGuard** leverages the **official schema** defined by the Cedar language.
- For integrated languages without an official schema, a **custom schema** must be created to ensure compatibility with **PermGuard's unified model**.

This approach ensures a **consistent layer of resources and actions**, allowing interoperability across different applicationsâ€”even when using different policy languages.

Each language can **extend** the schema to meet its specific needs, but a **shared foundational layer** maintains consistency.

## Version Management

Since everything is managed on an **immutable policy ledger**, this design provides:

- **Version control** for policies.
- Support for **multiple schema versions** across different policy languages.
- Reliable and structured updates without breaking existing policies.
