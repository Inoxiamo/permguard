**Permguard** is designed with Zero Trust principles at its core, leveraging the **ZTAuth*** architecture to ensure secure, scalable, and reliable authorization in modern, distributed environments.

---

## Three Core Principles of Zero Trust

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**
   Every access request, regardless of origin or previous validation, must be verified before granting access. This principle ensures that trust is not assumed but continuously validated.

2. **Enforce Least Privilege Access**
   Users, services, and devices should only have access to the resources necessary to perform their tasks. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized actions and potential breaches.

3. **Assume Breach**
   Architect systems with the assumption that a breach can and will occur. This ensures that security measures are in place to minimize damage and maintain resilience even in compromised scenarios.

## How Permguard Implements ZTAuth*

**Permguard** adopts the **ZTAuth*** architecture to bring Zero Trust principles into the realm of authorization. Here's how:

- **Decoupled Authorization**
  Permguard separates authorization from authentication, ensuring that access control is managed independently of identity verification. This enables consistent authorization policies across different systems and identity providers.

- **Policy-Driven Access**
  Authorization decisions in Permguard are based on clearly defined policies that align with Zero Trust principles. These policies are versioned, auditable, and enforce least privilege access.

- **Proximity Nodes for Autonomy**
  Permguard supports **proximity nodes**, allowing policies and permissions to be enforced even in partially connected or disconnected environments. This ensures continuity and security, regardless of network availability.

- **Bring Your Own Identity (BYOI)**
  Permguard integrates seamlessly with existing identity providers, such as Keycloak or commercial solutions. This flexibility ensures that organizations can adopt Zero Trust authorization without disrupting their current authentication workflows.

## Why ZTAuth* Matters for Authorization

The **ZTAuth*** architecture brings key benefits to modern authorization systems:

- **Scalability**: Policies and permissions are designed to scale across multi-account and multi-tenant environments.

- **Governance-Ready**: All policies are versionable and auditable, making it easier to align with compliance requirements.

- **Flexibility**: Supports integration with diverse systems and identity providers, enabling seamless adoption.

By adopting ZTAuth*, Permguard empowers organizations to implement **Zero Trust authorization** that is robust, scalable, and future-proof.
