This example shows how `MagicFarmacia`, a SaaS pharmacy platform with multiple branches in different cities, uses `PermGuard` for authorization and access control in a `multi-tenant` environment.

## Check Out the Playground

The first step is to check out the `MagicFarmacia` playground.

This example demonstrates PermGuard in action and allows testing of its features.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:permguard/playground-cedar.git
cd playground-cedar
```

## Startup the AuthZ Server

The first operative step is to start the AuthZ server.

{{< callout context="note" icon="info-circle" >}}
Plese refer to the [Install & Bootstrap](/docs/0.1/getting-started/install-bootstrap/) section for more information about the installation process.
{{< /callout >}}

```shell
docker run --rm -it -p 9091:9091 -p 9092:9092 -p 9094:9094 permguard/demo-all-in-one:latest
```

## Create the Zone and Policy Store

The next step is to create a zone and the policy store.

{{< callout context="note" icon="info-circle" >}}
Plese refer to the [Command Line](/docs/0.1/command-line/how-to-use/) section for more information about the available commands.
{{< /callout >}}

```shell
permguard zones create --name demozone
permguard authz ledgers create --name magicfarmacia --zoneid 386017848379
```

## Checkout and Set Up the Workspace

In this step, you need set up the workspace and check out the policy store.

{{< callout context="note" icon="info-circle" >}}
A workspace represents a local working space. Plese refer to the [CodeOps Workspace](/docs/0.1/code-ops/initializing-the-workspace/) section for more information about the workspace.
{{< /callout >}}

```shell
permguard init
permguard remote add origin localhost
permguard checkout origin/386017848379/magicfarmacia
```

## Apply the Policies

At this stage, since the playground already includes some sample policies, it is necessary to apply the changes.

{{< callout context="note" icon="info-circle" >}}
A workspace represents a local working space. Plese refer to the [CodeOps Coding](/docs/0.1/code-ops/coding/) section for more information about the workspace.
{{< /callout >}}

```shell
permguard apply
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following output:

```shell
‚ùØ permguard apply

## Perform the Authorization Check

The final step is to perform the authorization check.

{{< callout context="note" icon="info-circle" >}}
Plese refer to the [Command Line](/docs/0.1/command-line/authz/check/) section for more information about the available commands.
{{< /callout >}}
