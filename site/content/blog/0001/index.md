In today’s digital landscape, authentication is essential, but it’s not enough.

True security requires a modern authorization model—programmable, repeatable, and built for scalable governance.

Managing access to sensitive data and services across applications can be challenging with outdated models that are slow and difficult to govern as corporate requirments grow.
